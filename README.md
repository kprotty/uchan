This is (almost) a drop-in replacement for `std::sync::mpsc` with a focus on being lock-free and scalable for both producers and consumers.
It also supports being used as `#![no_std]`, in which the caller provides a trait used to block and unblock a thread, with the queue implementing everything else from there.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
uchan = "0.1.4"
```

## Benchmarking

```bash
cd benchmark
cargo run --release
```

For adding custom channels to the benchmark, see `benchmark/src/queues.rs`.
